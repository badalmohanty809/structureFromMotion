# structureFromMotion

The aim of this project is to create **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** from the historical aerial photgraphs using the concept of **Structure-from-Motion (SfM)**.

<div style="border-left: 2px solid gray; padding-left: 10px; height: 100px;">
Structure from Motion is a technique that makes a 3D model using many normal photos taken from different sides.
Idealy, first several photos are taken of an object or place while moving around it. Then the computer looks at all the photos, tracks common points, and rebuilds the shape in 3D.
